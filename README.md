Open Cart Shipping Extension

This mod works just like the default flat rate shipping module. It just gives the user another flat rate shipping method that they can select if they happen to be in a separate category from those that qualify for the default shipping rate.

Just upload the files via ftp, allow permissions to access and modify in settings, activate and insert your shipping rates.
